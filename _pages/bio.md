Before joining NYUAD in 2024, I was an Associate Professor at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/index.html) in Canada where I held a [Tier II Canada Research Chair in Software reuse](https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=4393). During my time at the UofA (2016-2024), I established and led the Software Maintenance and Reuse (SMR) lab. I obtained my Master's (2010) and PhD (2014) degrees from the [The University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) under the supervision of [Ric Holt](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~holt/) and spent approximately two years as a post-doctoral researcher at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/) in Germany working with [Mira Mezini]("https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/staff/mira_mezini/). I also spent part of my sabbatical in 2022/2023 with the [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com) team working with [Max Schaefer](https://github.com/max-schaefer)
