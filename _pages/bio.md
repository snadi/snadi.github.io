After obtaining my BSc in Computer Science from [The American University in Cairo](https://www.aucegypt.edu/home) in 2007, I worked as a software developer for around 8 months at [ITWorx](https://www.itworx.com) before moving to Waterloo. I obtained both my Master's degree (2010) and PhD degree (2014) from the [The University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) under the supervision of [Ric Holt](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~holt/). I then worked as a post-doctoral researcher in [Mira Mezini]("https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/staff/mira_mezini/)'s group at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/) for about 2 years before joining the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) as an Assistant Professor in 2016. In 2017, I was awarded a Tier II Canada Research Chair in Software Reuse, which was renewed for a second term in 2022. I received my tenure and promotion to Associate Professor in 2022 and spent part of my sabbatical with the [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com) team working with [Max Schaefer](https://github.com/max-schaefer). In January 2024, I joined [New York University in Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/undergraduate/majors-and-minors/computer-science-major.html) as an Associate Professer, and I am currently on leave from the University of Alberta.
