## Personal

In my free time (whenever that exists!), I enjoy baking and cake decoration. I took some courses during 2013 and got really into it, but then things kind of slowed down towards the end of my PhD and with the move to Germany and all. Oh well, for what it is worth, here is a [link to my baking blog](https://sarahsbaking.wordpress.com/). You can check out some of the things I made including a wedding cake! I have to say blogging is not really my thing, hence the sparse entries :)
