# The Software Maintenance and Reuse (SMR) Lab


The SMR lab at the University of Alberta is located in the Computing Science Center (CSC) room 2-59B, and is led by [Dr. Sarah Nadi](http://www.sarahnadi.org). At SMR, we develop automated techniques for improving software maintenance and resuse activities. Our work relies on mining software repositories to extract useful information that is used as a basis for providing decision support for developers. Our research can be summarized in the following keywords:

![Software Maintenance and Reuse Lab]({{ "/resources/images/logo_web_color_2400_frame_transparent.png" }}){: .group-logo } 

* Empirical Software Engineering
* Mining Software Repositories
* Software Library and API usage recommendations
* API misuses
* Highly configurable software & Software Product Lines
* Software maintenance and evolution

## Fun facts: 

* We pronounce SMR as "summer". Yes, the pun is intended for Edmonton's "warm" weather... but even though Edmonton is cold in the winter, you will find our research topics exciting and our group warm and welcoming! Check out our [photo gallery](/smr/photo-gallery) for pics from some of our fun group events!

* Our logo was designed by the talented [Sven Amann](http://sven-amann.de/)
