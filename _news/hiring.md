I'm hiring fully funded PhD students for Fall 2025 (application deadline in Fall 2024). Please see [the student page](/apply) for more info on the NYU Global PhD program.

NYUAD offers a competitive doctoral package: in addition to a full-tuition scholarship, students receive an annual stipend, housing on campus in Abu Dhabi, and additional travel financial support to finish their courses in New York. 

If you are thinking of applying or have questions, please reach out at [sarah.nadi@nyu.edu](mailto:sarah.nadi@nyu.edu). Before doing that though, please read the instructions on [the student page](/apply), as well as the video, on how to contact potential supervisors.
