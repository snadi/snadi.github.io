The SANAD lab at NYUAD is hiring fully funded PhD students for Fall 2026 (application deadline in Fall 2024). Please see [the student page](/apply) for more info on the NYU Global PhD program.

NYUAD offers a competitive doctoral package: in addition to a full-tuition scholarship, students receive an annual stipend, housing on campus in Abu Dhabi, and additional travel financial support to finish their courses in New York.
