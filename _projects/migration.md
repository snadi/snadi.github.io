Software developers often need to replace third-party libraries with newer or better libraries, a process known as *library migration*.
Library migration requires replacing all API usages of the original library in the client code with corresponding API usages from the new library. In this project, our goal is to understand the library migration process and develop tools that can support developers in automatically migrating from one library to an alternative one.
