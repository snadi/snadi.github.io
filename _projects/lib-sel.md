With the abundance of software libraries available, finding the right one to use can be a time-consuming task.
In this research direction, we mine various software repositories to extract information that can be used to compare libraries across various aspects (e.g., their documentation, popularity etc.). 

Given the popularity of data-driven applications, data scientists have become more involved in contributing to various software components. We also explore what selection factors data scientists consider when choosing a software library for their work.
