short-desc: Multiple versions of a software system can exist for various reasons, such as developing an SPL or simply forking or branching a repo to work on a given feature. At one point, these versions need to be integrated. Such integration is not an easy task, both from a software merging perspective and from the perspective of creating configurations from diverging behavior. In this work, we look at how we can facilitate such integrations and how we can help developers merge their code more easily with less conflicts.
