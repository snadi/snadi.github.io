In this project, our goal is to collect and compare experiences of companies that have successfully migrated to an SPL or that are currently in the migration process. This will be done through interviews with architects and engineers from various companies. Our focus is on technical details of the migration, such as the identification of variability in existing products, including details on the diff-ing strategies of source code; the modeling of variability and identification of features; and what kind of refactoring is needed to migrate products to an integrated platform. Examples of other details we strive to analyze comprise version-control strategies and product-generation techniques. [More](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/migrationStudy)
